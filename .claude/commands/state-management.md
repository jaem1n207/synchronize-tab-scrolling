# React State Management

Implement state management solution for $ARGUMENTS following project conventions.

## Task

Set up or optimize state management based on the requirements:

1. **Analyze current setup**: Check existing state management approach and project structure
2. **Determine solution**: Based on requirements, choose appropriate state management:
   - Context API for simple, localized state
   - Zustand for complex, lightweight global state
   - Custom hooks for component-level state
3. **Examine dependencies**: Check package.json for existing state management libraries
4. **Implement solution**: Create store, providers, and hooks with proper TypeScript types
5. **Set up middleware**: Add devtools, persistence, or other middleware as needed
6. **Create typed hooks**: Generate properly typed selectors and dispatch hooks
7. **Add tests**: Write unit tests for state logic and reducers
8. **Update providers**: Integrate with app's provider hierarchy

## Implementation Requirements

- Follow project's TypeScript conventions
- Use existing state management patterns if present
- Create proper type definitions for state shape
- Include error handling and loading states
- Add proper debugging setup (devtools)
- Consider performance optimizations (selectors, memoization)

## State Management Selection Guide

Choose based on complexity:

- **Simple state**: React hooks + Context API
- **Medium complexity**: Zustand or custom hooks
- **Complex state**: Context API with RTK Query
- **Form state**: React Hook Form + Zod

## Important Notes

- ALWAYS check existing state management first
- Don't install new dependencies without asking
- Follow project's folder structure for state files
- Consider server state vs client state separation
- Add proper TypeScript types for all state interfaces
