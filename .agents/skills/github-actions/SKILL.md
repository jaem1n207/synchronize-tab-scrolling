# GitHub Actions Build Artifacts

## Overview

Reusable GitHub Actions patterns to build React Native apps for iOS simulators and Android emulators in the cloud, then publish artifacts retrievable via `gh` CLI or GitHub API.

## When to Apply

Use this skill when:
- Creating CI workflows that build React Native simulator/emulator artifacts.
- Uploading iOS simulator and Android emulator installables from PRs or manual dispatch runs.
- Replacing local-only mobile builds with downloadable CI artifacts.
- Needing stable artifact IDs/names for scripted retrieval with `gh` or REST API.

## Quick Reference

1. Add composite actions from [gha-ios-composite-action.md][gha-ios-composite-action] and [gha-android-composite-action.md][gha-android-composite-action].
2. Wire them into `.github/workflows/mobile-build.yml` from [gha-workflow-and-downloads.md][gha-workflow-and-downloads].
3. Upload with `actions/upload-artifact@v4` and capture `artifact-id` output.
4. Download with `gh run download` or `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/artifacts/{artifact_id}/{archive_format}`.

## Problem -> Skill Mapping

| Problem | Start With |
|---------|------------|
| Need CI iOS simulator `.app.tar.gz` artifact | [gha-ios-composite-action.md][gha-ios-composite-action] |
| Need CI Android emulator `.apk` artifact | [gha-android-composite-action.md][gha-android-composite-action] |
| Need one workflow to trigger both platform jobs | [gha-workflow-and-downloads.md][gha-workflow-and-downloads] |
| Need scripted artifact download | [gha-workflow-and-downloads.md][gha-workflow-and-downloads] |
